					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Paul shows us that we are a totally interrelated body, not just independent parts thrown together. No part of the human body can continue to function normally when one part is in pain. The whole body focuses its attention on the area afflicted. In the same way, Mordecai sent word to Esther not to think that just because she lived in the palace she would escape the sentence of death imposed on the Jews (Esther 4:13). If she did not help, she would be destroyed, too. <br><br>Our influences and gifts are given to us by God to help others for "such a time as this" (Esther 4:14). Let us take inventory of the positions, finances, and grace of God in our lives and see whom those gifts were intended to help. If we keep them for ourselves and do not identify with those in need, we will cry for help one day and no one will respond. <br><br>Because Esther was obedient, the words of David's psalm came true in the case of Haman: "Look! They have fallen! They have been thrown down, never to rise again" (Psalm 36:12). </p>
