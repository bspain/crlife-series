						<p>Have you ever been in a pitched battle? Nehemiah was! As he neared the end of constructing the wall, he remained ever vigilant.  He never took off his armor in the day of battle and kept his weapon with him at all times. Relaxation was not an option. <br><br>At times the spiritual warfare in life can reach a fever pitch. Satan knows when you are approaching a breakthrough threshold in the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ. But just like a sports team that fights hardest in a goal-line stand, you've got to hold steady and remain firm in the fiercest moment of battle. <br><br>As Paul said, "Use every piece of God's armor to resist the enemy in the time of evil, so that after the battle you will still be standing firm" <br><br>(Ephesians 6:13). When you are facing a crisis and engaged in spiritual warfare, don't stop battling the devil until the breakthrough comes. There will be plenty of time for rest when the battle is won! </p>
