					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Society's hatred for the Jews has always been extreme and inexplicable. The magnitude of their suffering defies reason. The fact remains, however, that Satan knew salvation (Jesus) would come from the Jews, and thus he sought at every turn to destroy the Jewish people. <br><br>The Jews' worship of the true God and their rejection of idolatry led Mordecai to refuse to worship any human being (Esther 3:5). Haman's well-conceived plot looked foolproof, but God had been engineering a rescue operation about which Haman knew nothing. Working her way up to the right hand of the king was a little orphan (Esther), who would ultimately be the tool of deliverance in the hand of God. <br><br>Satan is enraged by anyone who refuses to bow down and worship him, and he will do whatever he can to destroy such a person.  Satan's best plans, however, are no match for God, who knows the end from the beginning and the "way out" of the problem before the "way in" even existed! <br><br>Stand still and wait on God, for He has known the solution to your problem since before it came into existence! </p>
