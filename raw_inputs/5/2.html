					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Often we become so caught up in working for God that we fail to be refreshed by God. Samson killed a thousand men with a don-key's jawbone. What a wonderful feat! However, in spite of this accomplishment, he cried out, "Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of these pagan people?" (v. 18). In other words, Samson had worked hard for God, but now he needed refreshing.  <br><br>You may be mightily used of God in deliverance and yet be perishing from spiritual thirst. A burned-out minister is worthless to the Lord, regardless of his ministerial abilities. But God will hear your cry, like He did Samson's, and open up a supernatural spring for you. Verse 19 says, "Samson was revived as he drank." The psalmist said, "He fills my life with good things. My youth is renewed like the eagle's!" (Psalm 103:5). Refreshing and renewal take place whenever you bless the Lord with all your soul.  <br><br>Elijah killed the prophets of Baal and then was ready the next day to die and go to heaven. What is the secret of longevity in ministry and spiritual service? Lay down the "jawbone" every evening. Don't pick it up again the next day until you have been to the refreshing fountain of worship! </p>
