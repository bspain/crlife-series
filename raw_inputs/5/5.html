					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>The truth of this verse is illustrated in the lives of two women, Naomi and Ruth, who were delivered from spiritual darkness. In spite of all her problems, Naomi directed Ruth toward following the true and living God (Ruth 1:22). Naomi was a real witness to Ruth, because a true witness is always kind to the outcasts. <br><br>Ruth was a Moabitess, and God had cursed her people for fighting against Moses. As a result, they could not enter the house of God until the tenth generation (Deuteronomy 23:3). Naomi's witness to Ruth ultimately led to Ruth's marriage into the ancestral line of Jesus. The "outcast" became a "princess"! <br><br>Jesus was a truthful witness in His discussion with the woman at the well. He told her that she needed to repent of her five marriages and present adulterous relationship (John 4:18). Others may have talked about her, but only Jesus was truthful with her. His simple statement of truth set her free, and she received the Living Water.  <br><br>Let us spend our lives harvesting a spiritual crop for eternal life. There are endless fields of souls needing to hear the truth, and they are "ready now for the harvest" (John 4:35). </p>
