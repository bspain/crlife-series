					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>No greater work of the Lord is recorded in the Bible than David's slaying of Goliath. More than nine feet tall, Goliath presented the most imposing stature of any human being in history. The image of a little stripling boy walking and then running toward such a giant stirs the courage of all who read the tale. Let's note three of this story's many lessons. <br><br>The first lesson deals with the boldness of a person who is anointed by God. Saul and all his men were scared to death of Goliath, but the young man who had been anointed by God had no sense of fear. He had no concern or worry because his trust was in the God who had always helped him. He boldly proclaimed, "The Lord who saved me from the claws of the lion and the bear will save me from this Philistine!" (1 Samuel 17:37). <br><br>The second lesson concerns the methods of God. David refused Saul's bulky armor, saying only that he felt more comfortable without it. He was choosing God's methods over the methods of the world. Trust in the things of this world rather than the things of God will never bring success when facing an overwhelming battle. <br><br>The third lesson illustrates the works of the Lord. God can take the smallest human weapons and warriors and demolish the mightiest foes. Who would have thought that five stones in the hand of a boy could bring down the mighty Goliath? <br><br>Psalm 111:2 reminds us, "How amazing are the deeds of the Lord! All who delight in him should ponder them." Run boldly toward your "Goliath." He must come down in the name of the Lord! </p>
