						<p>Are you a disciple of Philip or a disciple of Andrew? There were obvious differences in their answers when Jesus asked both of them what they should do about the hungry multitude. His question was merely a test of their faith. <br><br>Philip saw the facts. His whole perspective was intellectual and negative, without any regard for spiritual vision. Anyone can rehearse the facts to God, but the facts aren't important to Him-He made the facts! Like Philip, the Israelites tested God's patience on their journey through the wilderness (Psalm 106:14). They could see only the facts: no food, no water, and no meat. But Jesus was there all the time, ready to provide for whatever needs they had.  <br><br>Andrew, on the other hand, saw the vision. He had a spiritual and positive perspective that allowed God to work miracles. Jesus is with you in the wilderness, and you, like Andrew, can believe in Him for miracles. He already knows what wonders He wants to perform on your behalf. <br><br>Will you be a disciple of Philip or of Andrew? </p>
