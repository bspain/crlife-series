					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>

					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Just when things looked the darkest for David, God was actually giving him the breakthrough. At Ziklag, David faced the lowest point in his life, for he lost his entire family in one day. After this tragedy, even his best friends were ready to stone him. Because he found strength in the Lord, however, God turned the whole situation around.  "David got back everything the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued his two wives. Nothing was missing: small or great, son or daughter, nor anything else that had been taken. David brought everything back" (1 Samuel 30:18-19). <br><br>Someone has pointed out that at Ziklag David was only seventy-two hours away from a miracle. Unknown to him, all the years of his running from Saul were about to come to an end. The test was almost over, but the final part of the test was the hardest. But afterward, not only did David recover everything, but he also gained a tremendous amount of wealth. He used that wealth to spread goodwill throughout Judah, and this initiated the process of his becoming king of Judah. What a turnabout from the deep depression of Ziklag! <br><br>You may think you have waited forever, but you may be only sev-enty-two hours from your miracle. "When Job prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes. In fact, the Lord gave him twice as much as before" (Job 42:10). Wait for God to turn your darkness into glorious light! </p>
