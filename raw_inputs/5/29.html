					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Meditation is not the process of clearing your mind, but of filling your mind with truth. It is like a rock displacing water in a vessel. Your mind is exposed continually to the doubt, atrocities, filth, and strife of the world around you. Trying to clear out those thoughts is very difficult, but there is a remedy: meditation upon God's Word. <br><br>It takes a conscious effort to focus your mind and heart upon the truth of God's Word. Once you do, however, you will reap the benefits. Joshua 1:8 says, "Study this Book of the Law continually. Meditate on it day and night so you may be sure to obey all that is written in it. Only then will you succeed." <br><br>Reading the Bible is good, but meditation is life changing, for it involves thinking about a verse until it drops from your mind into your heart. The root word meditate means "to mutter," or "to utter." The more you speak the Word, the more it drops into your spirit. As you go about your daily business, speak the Word to yourself. Continually "mutter" it, mulling it over in your mind. <br><br>Whatever your area of need, select several promises that apply to your situation and memorize them. Then meditate on them all day long (Psalm 119:97). When doubt, fear, discouragement, and strife enter your mind, "think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise" (Philippians 4:8). Your faith will grow, your mind will change, and your way will become successful! </p>
