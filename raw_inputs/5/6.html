						<p>What would we do without the "handfuls of purpose," which the Lord of the harvest intentionally leaves out for us? If Boaz had not instructed his men to drop some daily provision for Ruth, she and Naomi would have perished. <br><br>When our lives seem insignificant and full of drudgery and routine, we must remember that God has things working for us which we never imagined. Just when Ruth's back felt like it was breaking and her bread bag was empty, she found a generous handful of purpose. Just when we think God has forgotten about us, He drops us a handful of purpose. <br><br>Joseph was languishing in an Egyptian prison. It seemed as though God had forgotten him and his life was destined to drudgery and misery. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, God dropped Joseph a handful of purpose in the dream of Pharaoh (Psalm 105:19).  <br><br>God will drop little signs here and there to remind you of His sovereign direction and destiny for your life. Even in your struggles, all things are working together for good because you are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). Never forget: "Boaz" has his eyes upon you! </p>
