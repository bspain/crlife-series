						<p>Envy blinds us to the truth. Jonathan pleaded with his father to spare David's life, reminding him that David had done him nothing but good. Totally persuaded that David stood in the way of his son's ruling Israel, however, Saul cursed and insulted Jonathan.  <br><br>The Pharisees also were blinded by envy to the reality of the blind man's healing. They refused to believe that he had ever been blind and then refused to believe that Jesus had performed the miracle. They stubbornly refused to acknowledge that Jesus was anything but a sinner, even if He had performed the miracle (John 9:24). Jesus answered, saying, "I have come to judge the world. I have come to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind" (John 9:39). <br><br>You will never convince those who are envious of the work of God that your motives are genuine or that God has truly performed a miracle. They will reason it away, insult you, and may even throw you out (John 9:34). They may remain blind, but one thing you will know: "I was blind, and now I can see!" (v. 25). </p>
