					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>What folly it is to trust in our wealth and boast of our great riches! The psalmist described the futility of hoarding wealth, which has no power to redeem our lives from sin. Ultimately, all the wealth we amass will be left to others. The psalmist continued, saying that the rich will not be pampered forever on their estates. One day they will die, taking none of their worldly wealth with them. Like all men, their bodies will rot in their graves. <br><br>Someone once said, "You will be dead a lot longer than you will be alive!" We would be looked upon as foolish to think we could send treasures to heaven ahead of ourselves.  Everyone knows that is impossible. The only way we can take any wealth into eternity is to give it to God here on earth and reap our eternal reward. <br><br>The story of the sacrificial widow clearly illustrates how God will reward us in eternity. It is not the amount given but the amount sacrificed that matters to God. The amount we give may be small, but if it represents great sacrifice, it is of more value to God than great riches. Just as each tabernacle offering was recorded in Numbers 7, so each of our offerings is recorded in God's eternal record. We will find those treasures in heaven for all eternity! </p>
