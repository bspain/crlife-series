						<p>How can we explain God's choices? In John 15:16, Jesus said, "You didn't choose me. I chose you." Saul was the last person we would have expected God to select as an instrument to tell the world about Jesus. But we know from 1 Corinthians 1:27 that God deliberately chooses "things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise." In choosing Saul as a divine instrument, God certainly knew that his testimony would totally confound the Jews. <br><br>Jeroboam, another of God's unlikely choices, was equally surprised when the prophet Ahijah informed him of his future destiny as the king of Israel (1 Kings 11:29). In a moment, because of God's sovereign selection, the entire course of his life was altered. <br><br>You may never figure out the ways of God in laying His hand on seemingly unworthy vessels in order to glorify Himself. Yet if you are a Christian, you are chosen. If you are chosen, you are ordained. If you are ordained, you will produce fruit (John 15:16). <br><br>Relax, and carry out your calling! </p>
