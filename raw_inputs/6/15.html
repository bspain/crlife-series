						<p>The spiritual gift of the word of knowledge enabled both Peter and Ahijah (1 Kings 14:5) to know the purpose of their household visitors. Without a direct revelation from the Holy Spirit, neither of these men would have had any idea who their guests were or why they were visiting. <br><br>The Holy Spirit knows all things and occasionally releases into our minds critical information that does not come from our own investigative powers. How miraculous it was for the blind prophet Ahijah not to be fooled by a masquerading queen! Instead, he called the queen by name and told her the reason she had come. He even gave an accurate prediction of her son's imminent death, which came to pass exactly as he had said (1 Kings 14:12, 17). <br><br>Let us reverence the Holy Spirit's gifts, for they are incredible tools that enable us to know both the circumstances and the motives of human hearts. Also, because He knows us as well as He knew Ahijah's and Peter's visitors, it would be well for us to keep our own lives pure! </p>
