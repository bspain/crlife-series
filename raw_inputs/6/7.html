						<p>How well the characters in today's readings bear out this scripture! Adonijah requested his father's concubine, a move that would have brought him much political power. Solomon answered that request by having Adonijah and his cohort Joab put to death (1 Kings 2:13-34). <br><br>Shimei disobeyed the clear instructions of Solomon to remain in the physical vicinity of Jerusalem. Shimei thought his disobedience in taking a little side trip to Gath would go unnoticed, but Solomon also had him put to death (1 Kings 2:36-46). <br><br>Ananias and Sapphira thought that a little deception concerning the sale price of their land would go unnoticed. However, they discovered that God does not judge us by what we think is right, but by what He declares to be right. God's judgment struck swiftly and left them both dead (Acts 5:1-10). <br><br>The devil is constantly filling our minds with little compromises that we must discern as evil. Our thoughts must line up with the measuring rod of God's Word. If they don't, we must run from them, because they will lead to certain death! </p>
