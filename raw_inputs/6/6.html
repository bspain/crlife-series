						<p>David knew what he was talking about, for he had faced one close call after another during his lifetime. Near the end of his life, he faced the ultimate snare: an insurrection in which one of his own rebellious sons attempted to usurp the throne from David's chosen heir. But God always provides a way of escape! The plot drew the attention of Nathan, and in a swift series of events, the plan of the rebels was foiled and Solomon was installed as king. <br><br>The apostles also escaped from a snare set against them. The Sanhedrin rulers were furious with the apostles for healing the cripple. They purposed to beat them, jail them, or threaten them in some way. Instead, the Lord delivered them, restored them to their friends, and filled them with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:23-31). <br><br>Satan's traps and snares are well hidden and powerful, but just when it seems his plot has succeeded, God provides a way of escape. Never fear-He'll do it for you! </p>
