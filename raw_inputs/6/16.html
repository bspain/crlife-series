						<p>Someone has called Elijah's journey the place called there. During the three and one-half years of drought, God always directed him to go there. God commanded a widow to feed him there (1 Kings 17:9). There is an exact place where God wants us to be so He can sustain and bless us. <br><br>Peter found the place called there when he was obedient and went to the house of Cornelius. Peter, like Elijah, was instructed to go to the home of a Gentile. This was the opposite of what they had been taught in their Jewish upbringing. <br><br>The place called there may not be the place we would naturally choose. However, it is the place where there is the greatest hunger. A desperately hungry widow and a spiritually hungry centurion both received the blessing from a man of God directed to their homes. As someone once said, "Where God guides, He provides." We must endeavor to always remain in the place called there. </p>
