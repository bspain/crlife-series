						<p>We are locked into a spiritual battle over areas of our lives that the enemy seeks to control, including our families, our finances, and our safety. But God gives us the strength and ability to skillfully confront and win every battle that rages against us. <br><br>David understood the principles of both spiritual and natural warfare; consequently, he fought his battles with not only the sword but also praise and worship. The results of his victory in spiritual warfare are evident in Psalm 144: blessings to his sons and daughters <br><br>God wants to bless you, but until you learn spiritual warfare, you will live under the enemy's curse. You may be begging and pleading with God for blessing, while all the time the thief is actually stealing your inheritance and blessings! <br><br>Begin today to praise and worship the Lord for the victory won for you at the cross and through the resurrection. Focus on your position in the heavenlies (Ephesians 2:6), and demand that the devil loose your family, finances, and security. Your blessings must release. You may have to fight for a while, but the victory is assured if you persevere! </p>
