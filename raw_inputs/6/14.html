						<p>This remarkable prophecy reminds us of the foreknowledge of God, for King Josiah of Judah was not born until nearly three hundred years after the word of the Lord had foretold it! Imagine if someone on the Mayflower had announced the exact name of a recently elected American president and had described in detail his policies and actions. Such a scenario would be similar to what happened with Josiah, for he fulfilled the prophecy concerning his life down to the smallest detail (2 Kings 23:15-16). <br><br>Our lives are not accidental, but are carefully purposed by God to bring glory to His name. We are indeed children of destiny. The Lord told Jeremiah, "I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my spokesman to the world" (Jeremiah 1:5). Rest today in the foreknowledge of God concerning your destiny. From the beginning of time, God has had His eye upon you! </p>
