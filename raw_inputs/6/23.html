						<p>Naaman's young servant girl had no idea how important her little remark to his wife would be in bringing about her master's deliverance from leprosy. God often uses the faith of others to start the cycle of healing and deliverance when a person is unable to start it for himself. <br><br>The four men who brought the paralytic to Christ and let him down through the roof were the direct agents of their friend's healing (Mark 2:3). Perhaps you can "hold the rope" for some sick friend who has no knowledge of (or hope for) healing. Though this person may not realize the importance of believing God's healing promises, you must remain convinced that God is the answer. <br><br>The little servant girl risked her life to confirm assuredly to Naaman's wife that if her husband went to the prophet in Samaria, he would cure him of leprosy. This bold statement of faith started the cycle of Naaman's deliverance and ended with his flesh becoming as clean as the flesh of a young boy. <br><br>In whose life could your faith make a difference today? </p>
