					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>In the midst of the terrible ordeals of life, we often don't know to whom we can turn. In 2 Kings 20, Hezekiah was facing death because a terrible sickness had attacked his body. To whom did he turn in his hour of need? The Word of God tells us that "he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord" (v. 2). <br><br>The "wall" represents the tower of the Lord. In his moment of desperate need, Hezekiah's eyes were no longer fixed on human methods and reports. The things of the world no longer distracted his vision. Rather, he raced to safety inside the tower of the Lord. <br><br>The Lord heard his cry and instructed Isaiah to have Hezekiah's servants apply an ointment made from figs. They obeyed his command, and Hezekiah was healed. Because he had run to God, God heard his prayer, saw his tears, and added fifteen years to his life (vv. 5-6). <br><br>The tower of the Lord is a supernatural tower. It is so strong that it can turn the sun backward ten degrees, a feat that boggles the mind when the laws of physics are considered. Leave your present fears behind and run into the tower of the Lord. It is the one place you are safe! </p>
