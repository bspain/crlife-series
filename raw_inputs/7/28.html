						<p>All of us get "out of joint" occasionally-with our spouses, with the Church, with other people, and sometimes even with the Lord. We don't mean to be that way. We don't anticipate our actions or feelings, but we find ourselves in dissension with others to whom we really are connected. <br><br>In speaking of the human body, Paul said, "The whole body is fitted together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love" (Ephesians 4:16). When we get out of joint with the rest of the Body of Christ, we no longer supply what others need, nor do we submit to the Head, who is Christ. We cause ourselves, as well as those to whom we are connected, much pain. <br><br>The remedy? One who "is overcome by some sin" (Galatians 6:1) should be restored gently by those who are spiritual. Such a person is still part of the Body of Christ, and we need him. We must always remember to deal in the spirit of meekness with one who is out of joint, because our Lord Himself paid the price when His bones were all out of joint! <br><br>Get back "in joint" with your spouse and Christian friends. Jesus is the "Joint" that joins you! </p>
