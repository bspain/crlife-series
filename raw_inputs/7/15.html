						<p>David insisted on paying the full price for Araunah's threshing floor. The idea of making an offering to God with no personal sacrifice involved repulsed David. His God was entirely too holy and worthy to be offered a cheap sacrifice. <br><br>Many Christians are looking for the "bargain table," where they can serve the Lord with little or no personal change in their lifestyles or comfort levels. The Bible tells of many such people, who desired the environment of religion without the demonstration of true love for God or man. <br><br>All love is shown by personal sacrifice. Jesus vividly portrayed His love for us by paying the full price for our sin. He took no shortcuts or easy roads to purchase our redemption. Willingly, He drank the full cup of God's wrath. He's asking us today, "Have you resigned everything to Me and counted it as loss that you might gain Me? Are you willing to pay the full price?" <br><br>God takes seemingly insignificant sacrifices and uses them to build His mighty kingdom. David had no idea that his little seed of sacrifice at the threshing floor of Araunah would ultimately lead to the establishment of Solomon's temple at that very site (2 Chronicles 3:1). <br><br>What have you offered to the Lord in loving sacrifice? </p>
