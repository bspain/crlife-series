					<h2>Daily Devotional</h2>
					<p class="author"><em>by Larry Stockstill</em></p>
					<div class="bible-passages">
						<p>Purpose can make a huge difference in a person's life. The crew of Paul's ship had given up all hope of being saved (Acts 27:20) after being relentlessly tossed in a mighty storm for two weeks. Still Paul was not moved. He knew he had a purpose to fulfill, for an angel had spoken to him, telling him that he would "surely stand trial before Caesar" (v. 24). Believing that nothing could defeat what God had determined, Paul encouraged everyone around him that all would be well. <br><br>When the circumstances of life fail to line up with your expectations, you can feel trapped, and the world becomes a hopeless place. God, however, has a plan for you, and when you find His purpose for your life, adverse circumstances become meaningless. No matter the difficulty, Satan cannot destroy you before you fulfill your purpose. <br><br>In Acts 27:28, when all hope seemed gone, suddenly a slight change appeared: the depth of the water lessened. As you cling to your purpose and God's promise, suddenly the battle will begin to turn. It may seem almost imperceptible at first, but nothing will stop God from fulfilling His purposes. <br><br>That's exactly what David experienced. After all the years of his trials with Saul, the day finally came when God removed Saul from the scene and "turned his kingdom over to David son of Jesse" (1 Chronicles 10:14). <br><br>Keep sailing. God is not finished with you yet! </p>
