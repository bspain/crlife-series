						<p>Never has there been an illustration of a people more excited and generous toward fulfilling a vision than that of the Israelites giving toward the construction of the tabernacle in the wilderness. The Israelites were so grateful to God for delivering them from Egypt that they delighted to give of their wealth and labor to build a magnificent sanctuary. Loaded with the silver, gold, and jewels that the Egyptians had given them the night of their departure, they willingly set their hearts to work, sew, and build. <br><br>The Israelites' example characterizes the power of the church when united by a common vision. Why not catch the vision of your church and apply your full strength and resources toward making that vision a reality? What has God given you? A talent? Some unexpected income? Some extra time? Find the vision God is building in you and your church and then work with your whole soul toward achieving it until you have to be told, "Enough!" <br><br>Jesus gave His all on the cross. He withheld nothing. The least you can do is to give bountifully of the resources His death secured for you! </p>
